            <p>"Pat has slip-covered two couches and two club chairs for us that fit like gloves.
                From start to finish, working with her is easy and enjoyable. She offers a wide
                selection of fabric samples and has finished each project to perfection ahead of
                time. Beyond these major undertakings, she has monogrammed pillow cases for
                anniversary and wedding gifts, sewn fun fabric coil bowls and coasters, created
                holiday runners and purse organizers that I have given to friends and family. She
                is always up for a creative challenge and never seems daunted by any problem
                she might encounter.”

                as sewing for my own business, Kate Martin Design. Pat is talented at what she does, and 
                has a great eye for color and design. The quality of her work has always surpassed my expectations. 
                She is creative and willing to work with you from the design stage through to the end. She is patient, 
                flexible and listens to your needs, making sure that her clients are happy when they leave
                her studio. I can't say enough good things about Pat and her business, Just Sew.  I

                 sewing slip and cushion covers and any other sewing project you need completed.  I consulted 
                 with her to  replace my patio furniture cushions.  She came over and sat down with me and we 
                 looked through fabrics and discussed many options.  My new cushions are beautiful and 
                 well-constructed.  I truly enjoyed working with Pat and I highly recommend her.”

                work is outstanding. Pat made a slipcover which is amazing because you don't know it's a cover,
                it looks like original fabric. She also made outdoor cushions, helping me to get the right 
                fabric and design. Pat is currently making two new cushions for some armchairs as she does

                living room chairs. The slipcovers fit so perfectly that everyone asks me who reupholstered my 
                chairs! There's no looseness to any of the fabric and the finish seams are done perfectly.  
                I still have my comfy chairs and they look better than when I originally purchased them. Pat 
                was also wonderful to work with. She gave me a realistic appraisal of her time frame and stayed 
                in touch throughout the process. She gets 5++ stars from me for her work.”
