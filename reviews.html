            <p>“I highly recommend Just Sew.  Pat has made several items for me over the years
                    - from draperies, slipcovers, and even monogramming and embroidery.  The quality 
                    of her work is excellent!  She's made beautiful garments, quilted table runners 
                    and wall hangings.  Her rates are reasonable for the hours of work and the care 
                    she puts into each project.”

            <p>"Pat's work has made such a difference: Roman shades in four rooms, two couches and two 
                club chairs with slipcovers that fit like gloves in our living and family rooms.  Working 
                with me to select the right fabric, she has finished each project to perfection ahead of 
                time and with great ease. Beyond these major undertakings, she has monogrammed pillow cases for 
                anniversary and wedding gifts, altered bridesmaids' dresses for my daughters, and reconfigured 
                dresses, skirts, and pants for me.  She never seems daunted by a problem and talks through any
                 concerns she might have. "

                Santner is the best. Pat completes projects in a timely manner. She is professional, lovely

                upholstered.  Not to mention my closet; many of my clothes have been altered and now fit
                 properly thanks to Pat's sewing.  I recommend her most highly.”

            <p>“I have used Just Sew for just about everything. Pat has done personal work for me, as well
                 as sewing for my own business, Kate Martin Design. Pat is talented at what she does, and 
                 has a great eye for color and design. The quality of her work, whether it's the hem on a 
                 pair of slacks or a custom roman shade always surpasses my expectations. She is creative 
                 and willing to work with you from the design stage through to the end. She is patient, 
                 flexible and listens to your needs, making sure that her clients are happy when they leave
                  her studio. I can't say enough good things about Pat and her business, Just Sew.  I 
                  really feel like I have discovered a wonderful resource and treasure.”

            <p>“Pat is a wonderful seamstress who holds a seemingly unending amount of knowledge and 
                experience sewing slip and cushion covers, dress alternations, and any other sewing project
                you need completed.  I consulted with her to  replace my patio furniture cushions.  She 
                came over and sat down with me and we looked through fabrics and discussed many options. 
                My new cushions are beautiful and well-constructed.  I truly enjoyed working with Pat and
                 I highly recommend her.”
